## I'm starting a blog for my uni study

Why? Well over the past few years I have been fortunate enough to work as a tutor. Firstly, I
tutored highschool students \(mostly maths and some physics\) privately then I was fortunate enough
to get a job at my university, [UQ](https://www.uq.edu.au/), tutoring
[Programming for Engineers (ENGG1001)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ENGG1001),
an introductory programming course in Python and then
[Introduction to Computer Systems (CSSE2010)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=csse2010),
which delves into the basics of computer hardware and some embedded programming. Besides finding the
work enjoyable, I realised that teaching and explaining really helped to solidify my own knowledge
of these topics. Blogging about the things I learn in my studies is another way of summarising what
I have learned and ensuring I can understand it well enough to explain to someone else. Who knows,
optimistically it might even help someone else understand the concepts I am learning. But also...

## I'm _lazy_

I mean not in a bad way! But, if you asked my teachers from primary school or high school, they
would probably tell you that I didn't like to do homework and usually I would just choose to do
whatever questions I wanted in class instead of what was set. I would often talk to my friends in
class about the content and we would question each other and try to really dig into the concepts.
The thing is, this worked really well for me! I got really good marks and always felt like I
understood the content very well without having to grind questions. I think the reason was because I
really engaged with the concepts and asked questions. So some may say I was being lazy by skipping
the homework but I think I was being _efficient_.

## Too many notes

Something I have noticed over the past few semesters of uni is that I have began taking more and
more notes in classes. Back in high school I was quite careful about the notes I took and really
tried to only take down the important things I didn't understand and some examples. Instead, I would
spend most of the time listening to the explanation from the teachers, thinking about them and then
thinking about how well I understood the concepts and what questions I had. So this semester I want
to aim for a similar approach. I don't know if I will commit to absolutely _zero_ notes --- that
might be a bit too scary --- but I would definitely like to reduce the amount drastically and
instead focus on listening and understanding in lectures. Again, I would like to become more
_efficient_.

Now with that out of the way...

## What am I studying?

Currently, I am in the second semester of my fourth year of a combined Bachelor and Masters of
Mechatronics Engineering. So this semester I will be taking
[Robotics & Automation (METR4202)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=METR4202)
which I am probably the most excited for since I will get to learn more about how to create robotic
systems with regard to perception and control with some ROS. The next most exciting for me is
[Control Engineering 2 (METR6203)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=METR6203)
which is the first masters course I will be taking in my degree and seems as though it will build on
the basic PID and particularly state spacen control theory I have learned previously. Next is
[Advanced Dynamics and Vibrations (MECH3200)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=mech3200)
--- the title says it all really. I found the precursor course for this quite difficult but fairly
interesting so hopefully all goes well. I believe it will extend some of the SDOF systems I learned
about previously into analysis of systems with multiple degrees of freedom. Finally, I am taking
[Professional Practice and the Business Environment (ENGG4900)](https://my.uq.edu.au/programs-courses/course.html?course_code=ENGG4900).
To be honest, I have heard this course could be a little boring from people who have taken it but
I'll keep an open mind for now. I am interested in learning more about business but I don't think I
would enjoy learning too much about project management \(although knowing a little bit about it is
no doubt useful\).

## What's coming?

While I don't want to commit to anything too concrete since I am just starting to try this out, I do
think it's a good idea to set some basic goals. For now, I will aim to make at least one post each
week for each subject (for a total of four posts minimum per week). I would like to make even more
posts about other things like how I have tried to increase my productivity in the terminal with
things like [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) or other side
projects or even posts about concepts from the courses I am currently tutoring that I could share
with students but this depends on time and things can get pretty hectic on a full time uni load. For
now, I want this goal to be achievable and I can always extend it if I feel it's going well.

If anyone else reading this is also taking some of these subjects or just starting a new semester,
good luck and I hope you find some of the content I post here in the future useful.
