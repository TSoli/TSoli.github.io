Hi! My name is Tariq Soliman and I am a mechatronics engineering student at The University of
Queensland, Australia. I am interested in IoT, data science and machine learning, singals and
control systems and software engineering so I thought it would be cool to start a blog where I
explain the things I learn while I am learning them. Hopefully, I can give a somewhat unique
perspective on these topics as a student who is learning them rather than an expert.
